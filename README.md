ðŸŒŸ Proud to Present My Second Power BI Dashboard! ðŸŒŸ
After completing my first dashboard, I challenged myself to take the next step in my data visualization journey. This time, I created a dashboard analyzing Supermarket Sales Data, and here are some of the insights it provides:
âœ… Sales Overview: Total sales, taxes, and gross income.
âœ… Customer Insights: Gender, customer type, and payment methods.
âœ… Product Analysis: Breakdown of sales by product line.
âœ… City and Branch Comparisons: Performance insights for better decision-making.
